Chattr Instant Messenger
========================

NOTE: The current version has some graphical issues when compiled with the iOS 7.1 SDK.

Description
===========

My ultimate vision for this project is to have a free and open-source mobile app and server that would allow end-to-end encrypted messaging with minimal meta-data retention.  Currently the project has a functional interface with a proof-of-concept Parse hosted backend server.
